# Pocket Guide to America 🇺🇸

**Pocket Guide to America** is a modern, offline-friendly educational app designed to help users understand the foundations, principles, history, and symbols of the United States in a clear, accessible way.

Rather than focusing on news cycles or partisan commentary, the app emphasizes **civic literacy**—how American government works, why its founding ideas matter, and what it means to participate in a constitutional republic.

## ✨ Purpose & Vision

Pocket Guide to America exists to answer a simple question:

> *What should an informed American actually know?*

- **Accessible, not academic**

It’s meant to be a reference you can return to—whether you’re a student, a lifelong learner, or someone looking to reconnect with the principles that shaped the country.
